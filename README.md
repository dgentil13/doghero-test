# Technologies Used
* Node.js
* Express.js
* MongoDB

# Next Steps:
* Finish pages meant for dog walkers, the routes are ready, but the front-end doesn't exist yet, apart from sign up.
* Implement responsiveness.
* Calendar and Clock for walk scheduling.
* Error treatment in front-end, which is lacking.
* Testing with Jest, Enzyme and maybe Cypress for Front-End.
* Testing with Mocha or Jest for Back-End.
* Containarization with Docker.
